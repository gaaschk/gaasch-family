      <p className="section-title">Born circa 1698 — The End of the Sun King's Wars</p>
      <p className="body-text">Jean came into the world near the end of the reign of Louis XIV of France — the Sun King, whose aggressive wars had repeatedly devastated Luxembourg in the late 17th century. His earliest childhood was shaped by the presence of armies, heavy taxation, and the instability of a border territory fought over by great powers.</p>
      <p className="section-title">Wife — Anna Gaasch (née Gaasch)</p>
      <p className="body-text">Jean's wife was Anna, whose maiden name was also Gaasch. Direct examination of the Hesperange parish registers has confirmed both her first name and her maiden name.</p>
      <div className="latin-quote">Anno 1747, octava Januarii — matrimonio juncti sunt honestus Nicolaus Gaasch, Joannis et Anna Gaasch conjugum ex Alzingen legitimus filius, et Joanna Useldinger, Joannis et Anna Useldinger conjugum pariter ex Alzingen legitima filia.</div>
      <p className="body-text">This record confirms Jean's full Latin name as Joannis Gaasch, his wife as Anna Gaasch, their village as Alzingen, and their son Nicolas as their legitimate child. Anna survived Jean by seven years, dying November 5, 1750.</p>
      <p className="section-title">The Gaasch Cluster in Bivingen</p>
      <p className="body-text">The Roeser parish register reveals a substantial Gaasch family cluster in Bivingen — a small village roughly 5 kilometers southeast of Alzingen — active from at least 1685 through 1700. Jean Gaasch, born circa 1698, fits naturally into this cluster.</p>
      <div className="pull-quote">&ldquo;Jean&rsquo;s world was the world of early 18th century peasant Luxembourg — shaped by Catholic faith, agricultural labor, the rhythms of village life, and the ever-present burden of being a small territory caught between great powers.&rdquo;</div>

By the time Nicolas was born, the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had settled the continent and Luxembourg had passed to Austrian Habsburg control. A generation of relative peace was beginning.</p>

Simon — the direct ancestor — was the seventh child, born February 19, 1760.</p>
      <p className="body-text">Nicolas died in December 1779 — just one year before Empress Maria Theresa herself. He never saw the French Revolution. He died in the same Habsburg, Catholic, rural world he had been born into.</p>

He was 32 years old, leaving behind a wife and three young children — including 4-year-old Jacobus.</p>

      <p className="body-text">The 1840s brought catastrophe to Luxembourg. A potato famine, combined with the political upheaval of the Revolutions of 1848, drove hundreds of thousands to emigrate to the American Midwest. Between 1840 and 1890, roughly a third of Luxembourg's entire population emigrated. Joannes was part of this wave — he married Catherine Sauber just weeks before the Revolution exploded, and crossed the Atlantic with her pregnant. Son Peter was born March 7, 1849 — the first American-born Gaasch.</p>
      <div className="pull-quote">&ldquo;He had emigrated with nothing but his wife, his skills, and his willingness to start over. By the time he died, his son Peter had homesteaded Kansas, and a new generation of Gaasches was spreading across the American frontier.&rdquo;</div>
